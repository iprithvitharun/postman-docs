The Postman token scanner scans your public workspaces, collections, environments, and documentation to find accidentally exposed known tokens. This protects your organization and prevents malicious users from exploiting the tokens.

> Token scanner is available for all users.

## Use cases

A scan is triggered whenever your team members do any of the following actions:

* Change the workspace visibility to Public.
* Share a collection or environment to a public workspace.
* Make changes to a collection or environment that is present in a public workspace.
* Author new documentation for a Postman Collection and make it public.
* Importing collections and environments into a public workspace.

Scan results are displayed in [Security audit reports](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/view-and-analyze-api-reports/#security-audit-reports) on the **Reports** section of the web dashboard.
